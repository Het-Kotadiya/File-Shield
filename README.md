## üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Best Practices

- ALWAYS maintain original file backups
- Test encryption/decryption with non-critical files first
- Use strong, unique encryption keys
- Do not share your encryption key
- Store keys securely
- Recommended key length: 16-32 characters

## üîí Encryption Process

1. User uploads a file
2. User provides an encryption/decryption key
3. File is processed using AES encryption
4. Encrypted file is made available for download

## üîí Decryption Process

1. User uploads a file previously encrypted file using this tool.
2. User provides an encryption/decryption key
3. File is decrypted
4. Decrypted file is made available for download
